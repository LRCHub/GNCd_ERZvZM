I went away for the weekend
I sat back and started thinkin'
And when it came to mind
I began to smile 'cause it's so true
It's so true
Thing never stay,
The way I want them to be
When I was younger back then, it was simplicity
People care too much, but like the seasons; it all has changed
I wish it wouldn't be that way
Can't bring back what used to be
Life don't stay the same
Thinkin' 'bout used to be
Everything changes
(Life always changes)
Everything changes, changes
There was a time when I gave up on people
Disappointment just led me to be alone
Then one day I was told
To just stand on my own,
And it's so true
It's so true
Just forgive no regrets
Go on and live and forget it
You can't go back again
Learn to leave in the present
Learn from your mistakes
Like the seasons it all has changed
Oh, everything must change
Can't bring back what used to be
Life don't stay the same
Thinkin' 'bout used to be
Everything changes
(Life always changes)
Everything changes, changes
Oh it's time to heal
Time to love
Time to let go and time to move on
It's alright to laugh
It's alright to cry
It's alright to be and choose life
(Mmmm hm)
Can't bring back what used to be
Life don't stay the same
Thinkin' 'bout used to be
Everything changes
(Life always changes)
Everything changes, changes
Can't bring back what used to be
Life don't stay the same
Thinkin' 'bout used to be
Everything changes
(Life always changes)
Everything changes, changes
Can't bring back what used to be
Life don't stay the same
Thinkin' 'bout used to be
Everything changes
(Life always changes)
Everything changes, changes
